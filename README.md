Simulating respecing some stuff for the game rise of Champions

Dont expect me to ever create a User interface.

if you found this not from me spamming it on discord you can reach me on discord witht he handle:

I will surely add more stuff to the selectors file.

I would love to do some statistical analysis but I'm to dumb for this.

Also there are no failsafes against simulators running into an endless loop when using incompatible deSelect and addSelect functions.
best try running this crap for ~5 seconds to check if your simulators terminate.
